# Data Exploration Project

## Introduction
Since 2020, the global demand for food delivery has grown exponentially (Research & Ltd, n.d.) as COVID-19 causes consumers to stay at home and work remotely. Correspondingly, the takeaway market has also become very popular. In 2014, Uber launched an online food ordering and delivery platform which is called Uber Eats. Users can use a mobile app, or through a web browser, to read menus, view restaurant locations and ratings, order and pay for food from participating restaurants. Besides, with Uber Eats delivery, all people favorite foods are right at doors with just a tap of phone.

This report uses R to focuse on the following three questions to explore the information displayed on Uber Eats and hopes to provide users with an alternative way of presenting information from Uber Eats by analyzing data from gourmet restaurants across the United States and visualizing the data.

## Research questions
- How are the characteristics of the most popular restaurants?
- What is the factor that affects restaurant prices?
- How much cost can people expend for hot gourmet restaurants?
